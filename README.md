## üîç Description
This repository contains the homework assignment conducted through the teaching facilities of the Univesity of Birmingham, in the third phase of the Coding Bootcamp; a web application by the name "Employee Directory". This application was made possible and simplified by making use of the very popular <b>React.js</b> framework. Different "components" have been put together, with JavaScript functionality added to each, to create a singular more complex application, which is very useful for managers who wish to keep track of their employees, although the generic "employees" used in this app are retrieved using an API call. The user is able to view all employees on the labding page, and they can filter employees by eith first or last name. The user can also sort employees by age, phone number, or in alphabetical order.

Here is what the delpoyed application looks like in the browser:

## üíæ Installations
You can simply gain access to this repository after having created a Github account, and with the following applications installed on your local device:

1. VS Code
2. Git Bash/Terminal
3. Node.js

## ‚öôÔ∏è Instructions
After installing the above, clone the repository to your local device, and run the following commands in the local terminal in VS Code:

> // to install the node modules
<br></br>
> npm install

<br>

> // to install react-dom, axios, and bootstrap, a few of the main dependancies (libraries)
<br></br>
> npm install react-dom axios bootstrap

<br>

> // to run the server in the browser 
<br></br>
> npm start

<br>

Once done, simply open the browser and view all the employees in the table. Filter out the employees by writing the first OR last name in the search bar. On clicking the 'Find Employee' button, you will be presented with the employees who share the name you have searched for. To reset the search, simply click on the 'Reset Search' button, and the page will load a random list of employees into the table again. Using the three buttons provided, sort the employees with the respective purpose of each button, as suggested by the names: 'Sort By Age', 'Sort Alphabetically', and 'Sort By Phone Number'.

The same applies for using the app through the public link provided in the 'Description' section above.

## üíª Usage
The app is as simple to use as explained in the description above; it has made use of very sophisticated programming tools, listed below:

1. React JS Framework
2. JavaScript for logic
3. Bootstrap for styling
4. CSS for styling
5. Axios library for fetching info (API call)
6. API -> URL: <a href="https://randomuser.me/api/?">Random Users</a>
7. React-dom from React libraries, for page connections (though not utilised in this assignment)
8. React Hooks, for page functionality, in functional components
